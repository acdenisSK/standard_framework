//! Functions to parse the content out of the message.
//!
//! A valid content is a group, its subgroups (and their subgroups...), the group's command,
//! and its subcommands (and their subcommands...). A group need not be present in the content
//! if it does not possess prefixes. A prefixless group is considered a Top Level Group, which
//! is invisible to the user invoking a command, and only applies at the beginning of the content.
//! They cannot have subgroups, which must have prefixes.
